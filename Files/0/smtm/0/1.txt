To Whom It May Concern:

WITNESSETH
                WHEREAS "A trademark can be any word, phrase,
                symbol, design, or a com-bination of these
                things that identifies [my] goods or services"
                [1]. WHEREAS I become "a trademark owner as soon
                as [I] start using [my] trademark with [my]
                goods or services" [1]. WHEREAS "Every time [I
                use my] trademark, [I may] use a symbol with it.
                The symbol lets consumers and competitors know
                [that I am] claiming the trademark as [my own. I
                may] use 'TM' for goods or 'SM' for services
                even if [I] haven't filed an application to
                register [my] trademark" [1]. WHEREAS a
                trademark may be comprised of "words, letters,
                numbers, or a combination of those without a
                specific font, size, color, or design" [2].
                WHEREAS "strong trademarks are suggestive,
                fanciful, or arbitrary" [3]. WHEREAS "Fanciful
                trademarks are invented words. They only have
                meaning in relation to their goods or services"
                [3]. WHEREAS "Arbitrary trademarks are actual
                words that have no association with the
                underlying goods or services" [3]. WHEREAS a
                122-bit random value together with a 6-bit
                arbitrary value is, for all practical purposes,
                unique. THEREFORE I claim the two character-only
                marks, each composed of hexadecimal digits and
                hyphens,
                        3ce137d6-a6e7-4ea2-a214-337ddc17a1e3
                        a5e2b8b4-2c33-414c-b731-f6254e4bbe58
                as my own, for use as a service mark and a
                trademark. LIKEWISE, the unhyphenated variants:
                        3ce137d6a6e74ea2a214337ddc17a1e3
                        a5e2b8b42c33414cb731f6254e4bbe58

                Sincerely,

                D. Michael Parrish, PhD
